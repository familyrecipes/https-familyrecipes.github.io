        <p class="profile">Eli, from the perspective of Noah: <br><br>
            Eli loves the outdoors, but only if it's damp and terrible and risky.<br><br>
            In a cruel twist of fate, he is terminally blurry.<br><br>

        <p class="profile">Erin, from the perspective of Noah:<br><br>
            Erin is relentlessly cool at all times. <br><br>
            I think she used to be an assassin?

        <p class="profile">Dirt, from the perspective of Noah:<br><br>
            Dirt is 99% legs and 1% fatally hilarious.<br><br>
            He is seconds away from snapping all of our necks at any given time.

        <img src="./assets/claire.jpg" alt="AHchachaaaaa">
        <p class="profile">Claire, from the perspective of Noah:<br><br>
            Claire is shiny, tiny, and crime-y.<br><br>
            She might be supernatural and able to lure you into MANY lakes. Be on guard.

            Guess who designed the about-us page without proper supervision...<br><br>
